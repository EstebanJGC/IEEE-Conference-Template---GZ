\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
This is a template for IEEE conferences.
It includes a brief description of some input files useful to write articles for conferences or journals.

\section{Introduction}\label{introduction}
This template is intended to ease some workload related to the formatting, debugging, writing, as well as to ensure a professional and good-looking article. 
It is intended mainly for IEEE conferences.
However, the input files, packages and macros can be included in other journal templates.

This template is available in a public repository in GitHub (\href{https://github.com/EstebanJGC/IEEE-Conference-Template---GZ.git}{\blue{Here}}).
Any future update will be reported there.

\section{Input Files, Macros, and Packages}
The following input files are placed before ``begin document'' latex statement as: ``\textbackslash include \{$<$\text{path to the file}$>$\}''. 
The files to be include are:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{units.tex:} This will contain all the possible units that I have used so far. Example: ``\textbackslash mmsquared'' translates into \mmsquared.
    \item \textbf{authors.tex:} Authors' information, including their affiliations.
    \item \textbf{enics\_packages.tex:} These are great packages useful for writing manuscripts in Latex. These packages, used to prepare publications for journals, are commonly used by the research groups in \hyperlink{https://enicslabs.com/}{\blue{EnICS Labs}}.
    If some package cause trouble within your manuscript, feel free to comment it. Remember, these are extra packages, no need to always have them. 
    \item \textbf{macros:} It contains commands for comments, review, variables, and macros. Take a look at the file.
    \item \textbf{glossary.tex:} Common glossary used in my publications. Note that it's good to keep consistency between your different published works.
    \item \textbf{inputVariables.tex:} These are input variables for the article.
    Generally, these are specific for each project.
    Look at the file to see some examples.
    \item \textbf{ORCIDlogo.tex:} ORCID logo with hyperlink if needed to include in journal publications
\end{itemize}

\section{Figures and Tables}
\subsection{Figures}
Refer to the README.tex file within figures folder.

When you have images in PDF or similar vector format, the text presented in the image (PDF format) could not be embedded.
This depends on which software/tool was used to generate the figure and how the figure was exported from such a software/tool.
Therefore, when you check (through PDF eXpress in case of IEEE conferences) your final files will get an error.
To deal with this, a quick solution is to use the ``latexmkrc'' file, which is in charge of embed all the fonts.
To know more about ``latexmkrc'' with overleaf refer to \href{https://www.overleaf.com/learn/latex/Articles/How_to_use_latexmkrc_with_Overleaf}{\blue{How to use latexmkrc with Overleaf}}


\subsection{Tables}
Refer to the README.tex file within tables folder.


\section{References}
The references have to be placed in a separate ``.bib'' file (see ``references.bib'' file), and to cite it, you simply have to use cite command: \arraybackslash \\cite\{garzon2022embedded\} (e.g.,~\cite{garzon2021gain}).
It is suggested to properly extract bibTex of the references as follows.
Go to Google Scholar and look for the desired reference. 
Under the title of the reference look for ``cite'' option and select the bibTex file.

An example as follows:\\

@article\{garzon2021gain,

  title=\{\{Gain-Cell Embedded DRAM Under Cryogenic Operation--A First Study\}\},
  
  author=\{Garz{\'o}n, Esteban and Greenblatt, Yosi and Harel, Odem and Lanuzza, Marco and Teman, Adam\},
  
  journal=\{IEEE Transactions on Very Large Scale Integration (VLSI) Systems\},
  
  year=\{2021\},
  
  publisher=\{IEEE\}
\}
    
Note that the title option above has double parenthesis.
This is a MUST in order to show the title ``as is'', i.e., the capital letters (when written) are shown.
Ensure that the year of publication is correct.
Sometimes, google scholar takes the year of publication when the article was added online, and not when the actual publisher upload the final article within an special issue, volume, etc.
Therefore, the year of publication should be taken from the journal web-page.

Another alternative to get the .bib file is to go to the journal web-page and look for the export citation option.
Afterwards, select BibTeX option. 

\subsection{Manipulating the Bibliography Style}
Another useful hack is to use the ``filecontents'' package to manipulate the references of your article. 
This can help you to save a lot of space.
You can force \textit{et al.} after one or $n$ authors. 
Or simply get rid of the ugly dash line when two consecutive references, by the same authors, are presented. 
To properly use this package have to do the following:
\begin{enumerate}
    \item Define the package (see line 33 of the source file of this document).
    \item After calling the package, define the filecontents block. 
    This can be seen in line 35 of the source file of this document.
    \item Below begin document definition, the block created in previous step has to be called (see line 48).
    \item Finally, when defining the reference file, you have to include the ``filecontents'' name of your sub-file, ``jobname'' in this article.
    See the definition in the bibliography section at the end of this source file. 
\end{enumerate}

The filecontents block mainly present four options, which can be commented if needed.
The options are presented as follows:
\begin{itemize}
    \item CTLuse\_forced\_etal: It enables the ``et al.'' option 
    \item CTLmax\_names\_forced\_etal: If the number of authors is greater than this number, we will force (if enabled) et al.
    \item CTLnames\_show\_etal: Names to show after et al.
    \item CTLdash\_repeated\_names: This is useful when you are citing two consecutive articles with the same authors.
    In such a case, by default, while the first citation will contain all authors, the next citation (again, with the same authors) will be shown with a dash line instead of the authors' names.
\end{itemize}

\section{Conclusions}\label{sec:conclusions}
In this brief, we presented how to use homemade packages to write articles.
The above information is intended to be a guide, you are encouraged to extend the packages as you want.
All the packages are free to use.
Have a good writing! 


\section*{Acknowledgment}
Commented if not needed. The sponsor is on the first page
%The preferred spelling of the word ``acknowledgment'' in America is without 
%an ``e'' after the ``g''. Avoid the stilted expression ``one of us (R. B. 
%G.) thanks $\ldots$''. Instead, try ``R. B. G. thanks$\ldots$''. Put sponsor 
%acknowledgments in the unnumbered footnote on the first page.
